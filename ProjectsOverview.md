Description
• Use data, statistical analysis, quantitative methods, and computer-based models
to uncover insights into business operations in order to make better, fact-based decisions and to
find hidden value in an organization’s data. Utilize a “hands-on” approach to cover
topics such as optimization, forecasting, and simulation as well as machine learning, clustering
and network analysis.


Objectives
• Perform basic data wrangling and cleaning tasks including checking variable type, creating new
variables, subsetting datasets, and identifying missing data.
• Construct and interpret appropriate graphical displays and summary statistics for one categorical
variable, one numeric variable, two categorical variables, two numeric variables, and one
categorical variable and one numeric variable.
• Perform a linear regression analysis to predict a numeric response and/or test a hypothesis of
interest.
• Perform a logistic regression analysis to predict a categorical response and/or test a hypothesis of
interest.
• Use decision trees to predict categorical and numeric outcomes.
• Use linear regression models for forecasting with time series data.
• Use cluster analysis to identify related observations.
